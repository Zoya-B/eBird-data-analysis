This area surrounding the pond is densely covered in Mangrove swamp and other water based vegetation. It then perched for a short time on a low hanging mangrove root enabling a clear identification of its iridescent blue/purple plumage and other identifying features. Weather conditions were 8/8 cloud cover. I am familiar with this species from other confirmed sightings in world wide locations

The second dove was very bold and visible while it was more difficult to see the one in the nest.  Using my phone I took a couple of short videos, but they will not load also a photo which will also not load onto ebird!!!  Shame we did not have our telescope !!  The forestry guide reported that the nest had only one egg.
